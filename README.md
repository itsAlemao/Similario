# Similario
Similario is a fun and interactive thinking game. 

## Rules
You need to guess a secret word and you can only do so by trying out words until you guess it.  
Every word has a score, which is how similar it is to the secret word in terms of context:

`car` and `wheels` are very closely related, so they will have a higher score (very similar context).  
`banana` and `nirvana` are very far away (letters and pronunciation are not the criteria for similarity)

## Similarity Tool
This game runs on a custom AI that has been trained on word similarity.  
The source files used to do so are included in the directory
