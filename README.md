# Similario
Similario is a fun and interactive thinking game. 

## Rules
You need to guess a secret word and you can only do so by trying out words until you guess it.  
Every word has a score, which is how similar it is to the secret word in terms of context:

`car` and `wheels` are very closely related, so they will have a higher score (very similar context).  
`banana` and `nirvana` are very far away (letters and pronunciation are not the criteria for similarity)

## Similarity Tool
This game runs on a custom AI that has been trained on word similarity.  
The source files used to do so are included in the directory

## Italian language
There are many AI tools and models out there that one can use, but they only work in the english language. There aren't yet models that can calculate word similarity in the italian language correctly.
This project focuses on the Italian language and was developed primarily for learning and experimentation purposes.
